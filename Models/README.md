# Models

Most tests (in the 'standard architecture' of tests described in the report) are in the file:
`IST/tests.ipynb`

The original tests done (i.e. not standardised and organised) are in the file:
`IST/InitialSmallTestModels.ipynb`

There is a reliance on the following self-made modules:
- `spectrograms.py`
- `delta.py`

All requirements stated in `IST/requirements.txt` (generated by pip)

`IST/Tests copy.ipynb` is the same as `tests.ipynb` -- it was made to parallelize the tests

The full (and up-to-date) git repository is at:
https://github.com/nononognome/Models-Datasets

Due to the size of the models and .zip datasets, they have been excluded.
Some tests need to be re-run and so the .csv data for them isn't yet available. Some tests need to be run for the first time because it requires on previous tests' collated data.

The collation of data is also only half complete at: `Data Collation/Collation.ipynb`
