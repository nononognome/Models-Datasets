# Models & Datasets

Most tests (in the 'standard architecture' of tests described in the report) are in the file:
`Models/IST/tests.ipynb`

The original tests done (i.e. not standardised and organised) are in the file:
`Models/IST/InitialSmallTestModels.ipynb`

There is a reliance on the following self-made modules:
- `spectrograms.py`
- `delta.py`

All requirements stated in `Models/IST/requirements.txt` (generated by pip)

`Models/IST/Tests copy.ipynb` is the same as `tests.ipynb` -- it was made to parallelize the tests
