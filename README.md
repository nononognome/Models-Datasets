# Models & Datasets

Most tests (in the 'standard architecture' of tests described in the report) are in the file:
`Models/IST/tests.ipynb`

The original tests done (i.e. not standardised and organised) are in the file:
`Models/IST/InitialSmallTestModels.ipynb`

There is a reliance on the following made modules:
- `spectrograms.py`
- `delta.py`
